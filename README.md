   "A little familiar with gitHub, however this is a little different than what I have used in the past.
   Interested in Mastering C++, and becoming proficient in Java and Ruby. 
   ...But, hey who knows maybe I'll learn completely different languages and frameworks along the way!
   Knowledge is the key to success."
